After starting the React front-end, you can click the "Get Random Location" button to initiate a GET request to the Python Flask back-end. The server will respond with a random location and it's time that is in the 17th hour.

*App.js* is the structure and handles calling the fetchRandomLocation function on a click.
*App.css* is the styling for the page
*fetchRandomLocation.js* makes a get request to the flask server to retrieve a location and it's time
